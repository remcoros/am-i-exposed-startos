# Am I Exposed? on StartOS

[Am I Exposed?](https://github.com/Copexit/am-i-exposed) is a client-side Bitcoin privacy analysis tool that grades your transactions and addresses using chain analysis heuristics — the same techniques used by surveillance firms. Paste any Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from 0 to 100 with a letter grade and actionable findings.

## Container Runtime

| Image     | Source                                | Purpose                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| main      | `ghcr.io/copexit/am-i-exposed-umbrel` | Nginx serving static frontend + API proxy    |
| tor-proxy | Custom build (`tor-proxy/Dockerfile`) | HTTP-to-SOCKS bridge for Chainalysis lookups |

Architectures: x86_64, aarch64

The main image is the upstream Umbrel build — a static Next.js export served by nginx, with a reverse proxy to route `/api/*` requests to the local Mempool instance. The tor-proxy sidecar forwards Chainalysis address checks through Tor's SOCKS5 proxy for private surveillance database lookups.

## Volumes

| Volume | Mount Point | Purpose         |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| `main` | `/data`     | Persistent data |

## Installation and First-Run Flow

No special setup is required. The service starts immediately with no wizards, credentials, or initial configuration. Both the Mempool and Tor dependencies must be installed and running.

## Network Interfaces

| Interface | Port | Protocol | Purpose                         |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Web UI    | 8080 | HTTP     | Privacy scanner web application |

## Dependencies

### Mempool (required)

| Property           | Value                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Version constraint | Declared in `startos/dependencies.ts`     |
| Required state     | Running                                   |
| Health checks      | `webui`                                   |
| Mounted volumes    | None                                      |
| Purpose            | Blockchain API data through your own node |

All `/api/*` requests from the browser are reverse-proxied by nginx to the local Mempool instance over the internal LXC bridge (resolved at runtime and passed as `APP_MEMPOOL_IP`/`APP_MEMPOOL_PORT`), so no blockchain queries leave your server.

The upstream UI's "View on local mempool" link is the one exception — it's a user-facing URL, not an internal call. `startos/main.ts` resolves Mempool's `webui` service interface and passes the result as `APP_MEMPOOL_EXTERNAL_URL`, preferring a public domain, then a public IP:port, then the `.local` mDNS address (empty string if none, which is a no-op upstream). Without it, the upstream image builds the link as `<this-app-host>:8080`, which is wrong on StartOS where each service has its own hostname.

### Tor (required)

| Property           | Value                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Version constraint | Declared in `startos/dependencies.ts`                |
| Required state     | Running                                              |
| Health checks      | `tor`                                                |
| Mounted volumes    | None                                                 |
| Purpose            | SOCKS5 proxy for private Chainalysis address lookups |

Chainalysis address checks are routed through Tor via the tor-proxy sidecar for private surveillance database lookups.

## Configuration Management

| StartOS-Managed                    | Upstream-Managed |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mempool API connection (automatic) | None             |
| Tor proxy connection (automatic)   | None             |

No user configuration is needed. Both connections are set automatically via environment variables.

## Actions

None.

## Backups

The `main` volume is backed up.

## Health Checks

| Check         | Method                | Display | Messages                            |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Tor Proxy     | Port listening (3001) | Hidden  | Ready: "Tor proxy is ready"         |
| Web Interface | Port listening (8080) | Shown   | Ready: "The web interface is ready" |

## Limitations and Differences

1. **Mempool explorer links** — The `/api/local-info` endpoint returns empty values for `mempoolOnion` since Tor is handled differently on StartOS.

## What Is Unchanged from Upstream

- All 31 heuristics and 14 chain analysis modules
- CoinJoin detection (Whirlpool, WabiSabi, JoinMarket)
- Boltzmann entropy calculation via WebAssembly
- Wallet fingerprinting and entity matching
- Chainalysis address exposure checks (via Tor proxy)
- Privacy scoring (0–100 with letter grades A+ to F)
- Support for mainnet, testnet4, and signet
- 100% client-side analysis in browser
- All 5 language translations (EN, ES, DE, FR, PT)
